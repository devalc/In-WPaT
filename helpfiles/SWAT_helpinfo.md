# SWAT-Viz

***

This 'SWAT-Viz' sub-module interactively visualizes and tabulates reach, subbasin, and hydrologic response unit (HRU) scale multi-scenario outputs from SWAT model. This sub-module incorporates similar features as the 'Watershed Analysis', 'Hillslope Anlaysis' and 'Spatial Visualization' sub-modules but is developed for SWAT outputs.
